# Activity Notes Website
Activity Notes Web is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their daily activities and tasks. This project serves as an intuitive platform for taking notes, setting reminders, and keeping track of important tasks, ensuring that users can maintain productivity and stay organized. This project also called CATAT!.

# Purpose and Objectives:
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and accessible web application that allows individuals to :
<ul> • Record Activities: Easily create and manage notes about daily activities.</ul>
<ul> • Organize Tasks: Categorize and prioritize tasks to improve workflow efficiency.</ul>
<ul> • Set Reminders: Add reminders for important deadlines and events.</ul>

This project is a collaborative team assignment from my college years. It aims to develop a user-friendly notes application accessible via a web interface. Currently, the project depends on temporary storage on the device when it's running, highlighting an area for future improvement.
